I began my coding journey seven years ago because I wasn’t satisfied with my work at the time — I didn’t find it creatively fulfilling. A coworker recommended looking into web design and I thought it was a good idea. I tried out online coding courses and ended up loving using language in such a tangible way. After months of going through online courses and researching other ways to learn, I decided to commit to it as a career and joined a bootcamp. Seven years later, I’m still learning and enjoying the journey.</div></a></li>

Since scientists linked CFCs to the depletion of the ozone layer, they have been largely phased out, but old refrigerators and other devices that use CFCs might still be in service. Through inhalation, digestion or other physical contact, as well as from exposure to harmful levels of ultraviolet rays, CFCs can have a negative impact on human health.</div></a></li>

            Windows OS (operating system) comes as the default OS on their PC (personal computer).
            Users grew up with different versions of the Windows OS, so it’s difficult to change.
            Most people think Windows is the only alternative for their desktop PC. Aside from the Mac OS, they are not exposed to more alternatives.The Windows alternative I’m presenting here is Linux.

            Linux is an open-source operating system developed by the community. Linux is Unix-like, which means it’s based on the same principles as other Unix-based systems. Linux is free and has different distributions, for example Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian.
            
            Every distribution has its pros and cons. Each is used for different applications. Linux’s hard disk is considered a lightweight. It’s used in embedded systems, smart home devices, IoT (Internet-of-things), and much more. Android OS is also based on Linux.</div></a></li>

        </div><div class="box">You won’t necessarily feel alcohol’s impact on your body right away, but it starts from the moment you take your first sip.

            If you drink, you’ve probably had some experience with alcohol’s effects, from the warm buzz that kicks in quickly to the not-so-pleasant wine headache, or the hangover that shows up the next morning. Since those effects don’t last long, you might not worry much about them, especially if you don’t drink often.
            
            Many people assume the occasional beer or glass of wine at mealtimes or special occasions doesn’t pose much cause for concern. But drinking any amount of alcohol can potentially lead to unwanted health consequences.
            
            People who binge drink or drink heavily may notice more health effects sooner, but alcohol also poses some risks for people who drink in moderation.</div></a></li>
   
          <li><a href="#"><div class="heading" align="center">impact of technology</div><div class="box">In the past few decades, technology grows rapidly. And the use of technology is also increased drastically. It affects the life of people and changes the way of their learning, thinking, and communication. It plays a major role in society, and now it is very tough to imagine the life without technology. Both technology and society are co-related, co-dependent, co-influence with each other. Technology lays an impact on society, including the potential for society to progress or decline, in both good and bad manner. Our society is shaped by technology, which has both beneficial and harmful consequences. Human societies and technology have grown inextricably linked since technical systems like mobile phones, computers, TV, etc. are produced by humans and reflect the very basis of a population’s needs and lifestyle. Although technology improves the lifestyle of human being, it also a major concern for the future generations. Nowadays, people are excessively using technology which reduce their physical activities that directly effect their health. Also, due to the excessive use of technology there are so many cybercrimes happens everyday in which someone steals the identity or personal information of the victim, such as Unique ID number, PAN number, Debit Card, etc., and uses it to conduct a crime or perpetrate fraud without our permission.</div></a></li>
