        <p>Should I learn to code? As a software engineer coming from a non-traditional background (I was an English and Psychology major), I get asked this question by so many different people — from students on the brink of graduating college to people switching careers later in life.

            Learning to code can be a big investment of time, energy, and money, so it makes sense that people want to know whether learning to code is something that could pay off for them before they commit to trying it out.
            
            If you’re reading this, I’m assuming you’re wondering the same thing. Whether you should learn to code or not is, of course, ultimately up to you! But I hope to give you a way to navigate this fork in the road based on your interests and what you’re looking for in a career. Here’s what we’ll cover:

            1. Why did I learn to code? <br> <br>
            I’m an English and Psychology major who had a variety of jobs before I started coding. I began my coding journey seven years ago because I wasn’t satisfied with my work at the time — I didn’t find it creatively fulfilling. A coworker recommended looking into web design and I thought it was a good idea.
            
            I tried out online coding courses and ended up loving using language in such a tangible way. After months of going through online courses and researching other ways to learn, I decided to commit to it as a career and joined a bootcamp. Seven years later, I’m still learning and enjoying the journey.</p>

            2. How to decide if learning to code is right for you <br> <br>
            YOU SHOULD CONSIDER LEARNING TO CODE IF: <br> <br>
            YOU WANT TO BE A DEVELOPER
 
            One surefire way to tell if a career as a developer is right for you is to put in some solid hours actively coding — because that’ll be primarily what you do on the job! <br> <br>

For example, let’s say you want to manage a website for yourself or your business. You could hire someone to build it, but with even a little knowledge of HTML and CSS you could learn to do the work of maintaining it. Spending time figuring out how to make code work on your own, even for basic HTML and CSS projects, is a great way to see if it’s something that could interest you as a career. <br> <br>

Over time, if you find that you like writing the code that makes designs come to life and making a website interactive, that could be a sign front end development might be a career you’d enjoy. If you enjoy the idea of setting up your website’s architecture (the way information is organized and structured on a website), back end development might be up your alley. If being responsible for how your website looks, how it’s set up, how it runs, and keeping it running sounds like it could be fun to do for a living, you may find that learning to code and becoming a full stack developer is the right choice for <br>
